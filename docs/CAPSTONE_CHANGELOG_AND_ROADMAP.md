# CapStone Changelog & Roadmap

Living record of what CapStone has shipped, what is planned next, and what we have explicitly decided **not** to do.

**Maintain this file on every meaningful change** — feature PR, bug fix, doc update, field-test finding, or user decision to defer/decline work. Bump the `Last updated` line and add a short entry under the right section. Do not rely on chat history alone.

## How agents and contributors should use this file

1. **Before starting work** — read *Planned*, *In progress*, and *Declined* so effort is not duplicated.
2. **After shipping** — move the item to *Completed* with version, PR number, and one-line outcome.
3. **When the user defers or declines** — add to *Deferred* or *Declined* with date and reason.
4. **When docs lag the app** — note under *Planned* until the doc PR lands.

---

## In progress

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Fix bugs from field test** | As needed | Small PRs if field testing surfaces issues |

---

## Planned (accepted — do next)

| Priority | Item | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Medium | **Asset category field rollout** | Open Channel Flow shipped v251; Set Up I/O lookup dropdowns v255; next: Gas Detector, Analytical, Lift Station, Scales & Balances |
| Medium | **Cloud sync Phase 1 (revised)** | Key sync by Zoho technician name |
| On hold → **ready** | **Training video** | Track A + Inbox + Stage 0 complete — can schedule when desired |
| Low | **Optional Capture photo parity** | Only if field testing requests |

---

## Deferred (maybe later — not committed)

| Item | Why deferred |
|------|----------------|
| **Plaud Fork B — diary / RAG** | Ambient search, embeddings, pgvector, nightly digest — after Fork A Inbox is routine |
| Separate CapStone email/password accounts | Declined — use Zoho Users picklist for technician identity |
| Phase 2+ cloud photo storage, native app | See backend architecture when revised |
| Further `src/app.js` modularization | Not blocking field use |

---

## Declined (will not do)

| Item | Decision date | Reason |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Dedicated Zoho replacement subform or separate replacement history module** | 2026-06-08 | User: replacing the existing asset and making a note is good enough. |
| **Separate CapStone technician list / email login** | 2026-06-08 | User: use Zoho CRM Internal_Assets.Users picklist for technicians instead. |

---

## Housekeeping

| Item | Action |
|------|--------|
| **PR #8** — old docs PR | **Close** — superseded |
| **PR #88** — separate cloud login | **Close** — superseded by Zoho Users technician approach |
| **Note Pro hardware** | **Order when ready** — first-day checklist in `PLAUD_INTEGRATION.md` |

---

## Open questions / waiting on user

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Resend API key for picklist request emails** | Add `RESEND_API_KEY` on Netlify; optional `PICKLIST_REQUEST_FROM` (verified domain). Default to: `bradwhite@calibrationsandcontrols.com`. Until set, requests queue in Pending Sync. |
| Field test results | Fill in `docs/CAPSTONE_FIELD_TEST_LOG.md` after device testing |
| Plaud Stage 0 validation | Done — Claude MCP + CapStone Inbox → Zoho |
| AssemblyAI API key on Netlify | User action — see `docs/ASSEMBLYAI_SETUP.md` |
